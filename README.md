# learning_phaser
Simple game(s) to learn javascript's framework Phaser.io

## How to test
Please host the game on a local server instead of just launching it on your web browser. The easier is to use simple python server :

Make sure you're at the root of the project.

**Python 2**
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
``` 

**Python 3**
```
python -m http.server 8080
```

__(of course, you can replace 8080 by the port of your choice)__

Now, go on localost:8080 with your web browser. Enjoy!
